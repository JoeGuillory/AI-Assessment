# Ai Project
This Project is a demonstration of AI agents with some player controlled ships.
This project uses State machines, Behaviour Tree, Dijkstra's algorithm, A* algorithm, and Behaviours.
The behaviours used are: Seek, Flee, Wander, Persue, Evade, and Arrive.
## How to play
One you have downloaded the release and launched the .exe file you will be landed on the first scene of the game
### Scene 1
The first scene will be controlled by W,A,S, and D. You can simply move around and the Ai agent will Persue you. Once you get to close it will flee away from you.
 To move the next scene you will press N.
### Scene 2
In this scene you will control the player with the MOUSE. One ship will follow your mouse. Once it gets close enough it will start to Arrive at your mouse. The Ship will flee if it gets to close to the other ship in the scene.
If you press SPACEBAR you change the algorithm other Ai is using.
